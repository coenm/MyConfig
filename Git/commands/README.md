## Installation


In order to use these scripts as new subcommands with git, they need to be available in your PATH.


=========

* `git activity` -> Show the recent activity on each ref
* `git filesize-history` -> Show how the filesize changed for a given PATH
* `git find-blob` -> Find the commits that contain the given object id
* `git incoming` -> Show new changesets in the remote
* `git mirror` -> Push tags and branches from one repository to another
* `git outgoing` -> Show local changesets not on the remote
* `git stats` -> Show repository statistics
